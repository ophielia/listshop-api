defaults - ListLayoutServiceImplTest - 13 passed 4 failed

BIGGER TODOS -
    FREE TEXT!!!
        compromise - categories will be saved for free text
        limited categorization will be allowed
        user will see free text separately, and be able to drag to category

    HAIKUNATOR - put in a service

    eventually - Item - date added, And , date updated


CURRENT HOPPER:
    Clean up - front end
        add lists to existing list
        bug - legends when switching lists or adding dishes
        shop page print
        shop page skinning checkboxes (minor)
        shop page check off text - not green
        Clean up list of lists
        sub menus for dish, list and plan (i.e. for list - shop / add / manage / )

    Back End
        continue adding / consolidating error handling - not found and doesn't belong - which is handled by controller advice
        coming up on target / proposal refactor

    Front end - plans
        stub page for create meal plan
        continue migration to HttpClient





BACKLOG -
    add created on to dish entity

    autotag -
        some sort of cache/refresh for instructions

    clean up - not much checking for null userids, null values in calls, etc.
        needs a pass through with tests trying to break.

    shopping drone users
